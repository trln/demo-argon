    # solr request, with actual solr request being +1 your configured limit --
    # you configure the number of items you actually want _displayed_ in a page.
    # * If set to 'true', then no additional parameters will be sent to solr,
    # but any 'sniffed' request limit parameters will be used for paging, with
    # paging at requested limit -1. Can sniff from facet.limit or
    # f.specific_field.facet.limit solr request params. This 'true' config
    # can be used if you set limits in :default_solr_params, or as defaults
    # on the solr side in the request handler itself. Request handler defaults
    # sniffing requires solr requests to be made with "echoParams=all", for
    # app code to actually have it echo'd back to see it.

    #  (useful when user clicks "more" on a large facet and wants to navigate alphabetically across a large set of results)
    # :index_range can be an array or range of prefixes that will be used to create the navigation (note: It is case sensitive when searching values)

    # previously. Simply remove these lines if you'd rather use Solr request

    # Search fields will inherit the :qt solr request handler from

    # that specifies the same :qt as default for our own internal
    # testing purposes.
    #
    # The :key is what will be used to identify this BL search field internally,
    # as well as in URLs -- so changing it after deployment may break bookmarked
    # urls.  A display label will be automatically calculated from the :key,
    # or can be specified manually to be different.

    # This one uses all the defaults set by the solr request handler. Which
    # solr request handler? The one set in config[:default_solr_parameters][:qt],
    # since we aren't specifying it otherwise.

    # Now we see how to over-ride Solr request handler defaults, in this
    # case for a BL "search field", which is really a dismax aggregate
    # of Solr search fields.

    # Specifying a :qt only to show it's possible, and so our internal automated
    # tests can test it. In this case it's the same as
    # config[:default_solr_parameters][:qt], so isn't actually neccesary.
